Usage
=====

Use the link script to link a Windows DLL to a position-independent loader (and other resources) using steps provided in a
specification file. Specification files are specific to each loader.

	./link [loader.spec] [/path/to/dll] [out.bin]

For example:

	./link /path/to/loader.spec demo/test.x64.dll out.x64.bin

To try out the same output (on Windows):

	./demo/run.x64.exe out.x64.bin

To debug how Crystal Palace parses an object file, use ./coffparse

	./coffparse [file.o]
